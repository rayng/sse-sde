    Latest version of hybrid.cpp is able to calculate Esus. In order to do so one has to be careful in counting the number of samples for a given parity sector. The constraint is: psamples+msamples=Nsamples for each bin. I therefore had to hardcode a different version of averaging in the bins class in stats.h. It is called parity averaging. Quantities in the positive sector are averaged over psamples and conversely for the negative sector. The final samples over the number of independent bins is still taken over Nsamples. Next up is to test the fidelity susceptibility and then for the 1D case.

    Changed weights to that of -J\sum_ij SxiSxj-h\sum_i Szi TIM hamiltonian. Note that the optype bug was fixed and the initializaton of beta was positioned properly. Also plot.py script was modified to calculated energy susceptibility

    Fixed the system=disorder, uniform, staggered choice and created a subroutine that generates ../init/init.config. I should only have to change preprocc.hpp from now on. All subsequent scripts should read from init.config

    I mis-used #if(system) and it didnt initialise the fields right. It is working now after removing it and initialising explicitly

    hybrid.cpp is now reduced to the uniform case. Some tweaks are: 1. Removed appending 2. Removed replica beta_
